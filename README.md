## #1 - [Two Sum](./two-sum).
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_. You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_ one solution**, and you may not use the _same_ element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

## #3 - [Add Two Linked List Digits](./add-two-ll).
You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
