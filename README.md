# #1 - [Two Sum](./two-sum).
Given an array of integers `nums`Â and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_. You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_ one solution**, and you may not use the _same_ element twice. You can return the answer in any order.
